This is my first time doing web development in Java. I could have done this in Django since it is easier but since I wanted to learn how to use Java in a proper application I did in this. 

This uses a Model-View-Controller similar to Django and RoR, but Java is used.

Remember to deploy from the mainframe view and not from others. Go to MainFrame.java and press the run option in the file. You will find at public static void main section.

There may be issue as I developed this on VScode. If so then configure .vscode to become .settings


Have to implement navigating backwards which till now was done by drop down menu on the left.
