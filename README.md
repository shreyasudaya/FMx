This is my first time doing web development in Java. I could have done this in Django since it is easier but since I wanted to learn how to use Java in a proper application I did in this. 

This uses a Model-View-Controller similar to Django and RoR, but Java is used.

Remember to deploy from the mainframe view and not from others.

Have to implement going backwards
