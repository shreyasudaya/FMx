This is my first time doing web development in Java. I could have done this in Django since it is easier but since I wanted to learn Java I did in this. 

This uses a Model-View-Controller similar to Django and RoR, but Java is used.

To deploy use eclipse, or you can use vs code by using java extensions and create a java project. Copy the src, .classpath and .project
